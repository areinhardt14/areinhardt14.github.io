				<h2>Week 7 (July 10 - July 14)</h2>
				<p>We made a lot of progress this week, but we encountered some obstacles which means we didn't get as far as we had planned a week ago. First of all, 
				we had another video meeting with Dr. Hartmann and Elena, and among the things we discussed was the idea to synthesize code examples for the popup 
				by stitching together different GitHub examples following the same abstract pattern. So that is what Tianyi decided to tackle this week, while I continued 
				work on the UI itself.</p>
				<p>The final integration of Maple with the server was more difficult than I had anticipated, so last weekend Tianyi finished implementing it, so the server 
				now finds API misuses in the Stack Overflow code and gives us a list of violations that we can send back to the Chrome extension. This week, I created the 
				JSON message the server sends back to the extension, which took awhile because I had to keep going back and changing the structure of the message so that 
				we can send only the data we absolutely need (and since I hadn't implemented the plugin-side, I wasn't exactly sure what we needed). As a part of this process, 
				I created natural-language "violation messages" based on data from Maple. Basically, for each type of violation we wanted to return a tailored message that 
				would be as helpful and understandable as possible to go with the code example the user would see. So, based on the violation type (Incorrect Precondition, 
				Missing Method Call, Missing Control Structure, Disordered Method Call, and Disordered Control Structure) and whether a different API call or control structure 
				was needed, a different message would be returned. For example, if a try-catch block needed to be added to an API call, the message might be: "You may want to use a 
				try-catch block here. 1234 Github code examples also do this," plus a brief description of the API call pattern that necessitated this change.</p>
				<p>After implementing this, I also had to get rid of redundant violations we were getting -- if a code snippet was missing a try-catch block, for instance, 
				we would get four different violations: try, end-block (i.e. the end of the try-block), catch, and another end-block. I decided to save the violation that 
				was most meaningful for determining what the actual problem was that was causing the violation. So, for instance, if there was an if and an end-block, I would 
				save the "if," but if there was an if/end-block and an else/end-block following it, I would save the "else" so I would know that Maple was suggesting an entire 
				if-else block, not just a solo if-statement.</p>
				<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">Jackson</a> (which I had used for parsing the JSON messages a couple of weeks ago) to create the 
				JSON message with all this information to send to the server. It's a pretty nice library but sometimes a little frustrating to use because there are several, very different ways of using 
				it to construct a JSON message.</p>
				<p>After building the message, I moved back to the plugin side (and JavaScript) to grab the message and parse it. So far I am able to highlight the methods 
				on the SO page that are potential API misuses, and am working on dynamically generating popups for each one. It's been a slow process because I keep learning 
				weird JavaScript things that mess up my code for hours until I track down the problem. <a href="https://www.toptal.com/javascript/10-most-common-javascript-mistakes">
				This article</a> on the "10 most common JavaScript mistakes" has been helpful this week -- apparently JS doesn't have block-level scope, which was definitely 
				an assumption I had been making. Oops. Also, its suggestion to enable JS's "strict mode" was really useful; it enables stricter parsing and error handling which makes 
				debugging a lot easier.</p>
